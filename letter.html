            <h2>My Dearest Weirdo,</h2>
            <p>
                Happy International Womenâ€™s Day!! I want to celebrate youâ€”not just for the amazing person you are, but for the way you light up my world without even trying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every time you smile, my world gets brighterâ€”more vibrant. The sound of your cute little laugh fills my heart with joy, and your voice lingers in my mind, clear and warm. You are so silly, and I love it. Your personality, your eyes, the way you stand outâ€”itâ€™s all so cute. You give me the kilig.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still remember the first time we went out together. The way you looked at me made me feel like I was the only person doon, haha. You're so cute, with or without your glasses. Even when I look at your pictures, I get the kiligâ€”feet kicking in the air.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, I still canâ€™t believe how lucky I am that you chose meâ€”a nobody, a bum. I keep asking myself how I even pulled a goddess like you. Ako ay tao lang at ikaw ay diyosa, ikaâ€™y nagbibigay saâ€™kin ng ginhawa.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the way you care for the people around you. You are so kind and patient, and you inspire me every day. It reminds me how lucky I am to to have you by my side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t be there with you today, and Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t get you flowers like I wanted to. If I could, Iâ€™d hand you the most beautiful bouquet, but for now, this digital flower is all I have to give. I hope it still brings you a little bit of happiness, just as you bring so much of it into my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy International Womenâ€™s Day, my Weirdo.

                Have a great day,<br>
